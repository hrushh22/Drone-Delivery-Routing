Drone Delivery Route Optimization
üöÄ Overview
This project implements a sophisticated hybrid optimization approach for drone delivery routing, combining three powerful nature-inspired algorithms to solve a complex variation of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The solution efficiently plans optimal delivery routes while accounting for real-world constraints like no-fly zones, battery limitations, and delivery time windows.
